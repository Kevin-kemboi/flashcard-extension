## Final Steps - Quick Deployment

The fastest way to deploy is:

2. Run:
   ```
   .\deploy-netlify.ps1
   ```
3. Follow the prompts

## Final Steps - Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual deployment:

1. Sign up at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/)
2. From your Netlify dashboard, click "New site from Git"
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.`
5. Click "Deploy site"

## After Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. Visit your site at the URL provided by Netlify
2. Test the gesture recognition at `/gesture-core/test.html`
3. Consider setting up a custom domain
4. Share your site with others!

## Future Updates

When you make changes to your code:

1. Push changes to your GitHub repository
2. If you set up GitHub Actions, deployment will happen automatically
3. Otherwise, run `.\deploy-netlify.ps1` again to deploy manually
