# Flashcard Extension - Netlify Deployment Documentation

## Overview

This guide will help you deploy your Flashcard Builder Extension demo site to Netlify. The deployment will showcase the gesture recognition functionality without requiring users to install the Chrome extension.

## Files Created/Modified for Netlify Deployment

I've prepared several files to make your Netlify deployment as smooth as possible:

1. **index.html**
   - Landing page for your Netlify site
   - Introduces the project and links to the gesture test page
   - Responsive design works on mobile and desktop

2. **netlify.toml**
   - Configuration file for Netlify
   - Defines build commands and publish directory
   - Sets up redirects and headers

3. **_redirects**
   - Additional redirect rules for Netlify
   - Ensures proper routing for your single-page application
   - Directs users to proper pages when accessing URLs directly

4. **.env**
   - Template for environment variables
   - Add this to .gitignore if you include sensitive information

5. **.github/workflows/netlify-deploy.yml**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
   - Builds and deploys your site when you push to main
   - Requires Netlify secrets to be set up in your repository

6. **NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md**
   - Comprehensive guide for deploying to Netlify
   - Includes manual and automatic deployment options
   - Troubleshooting tips and best practices

7. **NETLIFY_STEPS.md**
   - Quick reference guide with step-by-step instructions
   - Summarizes the deployment process
   - Lists all the deployment options

8. **.gitignore** (updated)
   - Added Netlify-specific entries
   - Ensures sensitive and temporary files aren't committed

## Deployment Steps Summary

### Step 1: Initial Setup
- Your code is already built and tested locally
- Files are prepared for Netlify deployment

### Step 2: Choose Deployment Method
- **Manual**: Sign up for Netlify and deploy through their UI
- **CLI**: Use Netlify CLI tools for deployment
- **CI/CD**: Set up GitHub Actions for automatic deployment

### Step 3: Deploy
For the quickest deployment:

1. Sign up at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/)
2. Click "New site from Git" 
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.`
5. Click "Deploy site"

### Step 4: Access Your Site
After deployment, your site will be available at:
- Main page: `https://[your-site-name].netlify.app/`
- Gesture test: `https://[your-site-name].netlify.app/gesture-core/test.html`

## Testing Your Deployment

I've set up a local server that mimics the Netlify environment. You can test it at:
- http://localhost:8096/ (main page)
- http://localhost:8096/gesture-core/test.html (gesture test)

## Next Steps

1. Complete the deployment to Netlify using one of the methods described
2. Consider setting up a custom domain for your project
3. Share your gesture recognition demo with others!
